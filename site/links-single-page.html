		<h3>Joey</h3><div>
		<p><div>1. His love of sandwiches is so relatable. Everyone loves a good sandwich — but not nearly as much as Joey. Although he tends to get a little possessive with his food (especially sandwiches), we can’t blame him.</div> <div>2. He can keep a secret Joey might not always understand what’s going on, but when he does he can keep a tight lip. Case in point: After finding out about Chandler and Monica’s relationship, Joey managed to keep his friends’ love affair a secret until Rachel found out and confronted him about it. It was really hard on Joey, but he did it because he is such a good friend.</div> <div>3. He’s sentimental Although he might seem like he doesn’t care, Joey is a very sensitive and sentimental guy. That’s especially true when it comes to his friendships with Chandler, Ross, Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel. His sentimental side showed when he purchased a friendship bracelet for Chandler as a thank you for his support.</div> <div>4. He let Chandler date Kathy
		After Chandler fell in love with his ex-girlfriend Kathy, Joey was pretty upset about it. He even made Chandler sit in a box to think about what he did. However, after realizing how much the two cared about each other, Joey put his feelings aside and let his friend be happy.</div> <div>5. He gave up meat for Phoebe when Phoebe craved meat during her pregnancy, Joey was quick to be there for his vegetarian friend. To counter the meat Phoebe ate during her pregnancy, he offered to go vegetarian. And although he slipped up in London, he did his best to support his friend’s cause.</div> <div>6. He ate meat for Rachel after Rachel accidentally made a Shepherd’s pie trifle cake, Joey didn’t think twice about eating it. Even though he didn’t do it to make her feel better — he genuinely thought it was delicious — he still was there for her friend during a major faux pas.</div> <div>7. He is selfless While he might act childish at times, Joey always does the selfless thing. Case in point: Even though it was hard for him, he let Emma have Hugsy, his favorite stuffed animal.</div> <div>8. He saved the trees after Phoebe learned what happens to the dead Christmas trees at the tree lot, she was so upset. Joey did what Joey does and bought all them so they wouldn’t end up in the chipper — a fate that was very disturbing to Phoebe.</div> <div>9. His pick-up line is the essence of his character
		“How you doin’” is probably the worst and best pick-up line of all time. So, it’s fitting that Joey uses it as a universal way to pick up women. And while his go-to phrase could very easily turn fans against his character, there’s something so fitting about the line that makes us love him even more.</div> <div>10. He’d do anything for his friends no matter what happens, Joey is an amazing friend and would do anything for Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe. He often goes out of his way to be there for his friends and epitomizes what it means to have friends that are like family.</div>

		<h3>Monica</h3><div>
		<p><div>1. She’s a really great friend	monica is the best Friends character for many reasons, but what stands out the most is her dedication to her friends. whenever they need a shoulder to cry on, she is there. She always makes sure her friends are taken care of — aka, well-fed — supports their career achievements, and solicits advice whenever it’s needed.</div><div>2. She let Rachel move in with her after Rachel ran out on her wedding, she told her dad she was moving in with Monica. Despite not talking to her about it first, Monica hardly bats an eye and agrees to let Rachel move in with her. At the time, they two were reconnecting and not nearly as close as they once were. However, that doesn’t stop Monica from supporting a friend in need.</div><div>3. Her friends would go hungry without her as a chef, Monica always cooks — and always has food for her friends to enjoy. Even when she lost her job, she was still cooking up a storm for Joey and others that frequented her kitchen. Without her, they all would have starved.</div><div>4. She’s honest Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and the rest of the Friends characters can always count on Monica’s honesty. And while she’s sometimes a little too honest, her willingness to tell the truth (and speak her mind) usually does them good. Of all the characters, she’s the voice of reason.</div><div>5. She sticks to her word in addition to her honesty, Monica never breaks a promise — even when her friends ask her to. Who could forget the time Rachel gave her control over her dating life? After Rachel tried to fire her, she refused and argued that she was in charge of Rachel’s life, therefore she was not fired.</div><div>6. She’s a great sister Ross and Monica might not always get along, but they have immense love and support for one another. Despite his breakup with her best friend — Rachel — Monica tried her best to be there for her brother during the hard times, without ruining her friendship with Rachel. Also, Monica always offers her babysitting services, is happy to meet Ross’ new girlfriends, and is incredibly gracious and kind to her older brother.</div><div>7. She drives everyone nuts and doesn’t care if there is one character on the show that is true to themselves, it’s Monica. Sure, she’s a little obsessed with cleaning and can be highly competitive, but she recognizes it and owns it. In many ways, her competitive nature is one of her biggest strengths.</div>

		<h3>Rachel</h3><div>
		<p><div>1. She’s incredibly loyal one of the most important reasons why Rachel Green is the best Friends character is her loyalty. The show is all about friendship and Rachel embodies that with everything she does — in goods times and in bad. Whether it’s consoling Monica or supporting Phoebe’s music career, she always offered her empathy and loyalty.</div> <div>2. She goes after what she wants whether it’s in dating or her career, Rachel isn’t afraid to go after what she wants. In the series, she goes from marrying for money to a full-fledged career woman — all thanks to her grit. In many ways, she has her confidence to thank for her success. While we do see glimpses of her insecurities throughout the series, she — for the most part — exudes confidence.</div><div>3. Her sense of humor is unmatched can we all agree that Rachel is the funniest character on Friends? Or, at least always there at the right time to provide some belly-laughing feedback. Whether she’s calling Ross out for his marriage history or having a grand old time with Joey in their shared apartment, Rachel has a sense of humor unlike any of the others.</div><div>4. Her cooking skills are relatable
		while we are happy we weren’t there to taste Rachel’s infamous English trifle, we sure can relate. “First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard — which I made from scratch — then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top,” Rachel described during the season 6 Thanksgiving episode. As it turned out, the, shall we say, interesting mashup was a result of two cookbook pages stuck together. Instead of making a traditional English Trifle, Rachel mistakenly added her own spin on it with some Shepherd’s Pie ingredients.</div><div>5. She isn’t afraid to try new things seaking of her cooking skills, Rachel is always up for trying new things. Whether it be helping Monica in the kitchen or playing football on Thanksgiving, she always does her best and is up for a challenge.</div><div>6. She’s a trendsetter when it comes to style, Rachel knows what she’s doing. Her character is a direct representation of many women in New York City, who moved there to make it big in fashion. From her shopping addiction to her career at Ralph Lauren, Rachel’s love of fashion shines through in most episodes. While some of her clothing might be outdated now — after all, the show was filmed in the 90s and early 2000s — her style choices were ultra trendy and trendsetting at the time. Today, a lot of fashion from the Friends era is back in style, and Rachel’s fashion choices are often referenced on popular style sites and social media.</div><div>7. She stands up for women Who can forget Rachel’s famous line, “no uterus, no opinion?” After receiving some feedback about childbirth from Joey and Ross, Rachel famously pointed her finger at them and responded with her witty feminist antics. Rachel’s pregnancy brought out a lot of her feminist side and shed light on some common things women experienced (and still do) in the workplace, too.</div><div>8. She’s Ross’ lobster another reason why Rachel Green is the best Friends character? She is Ross’ lobster. We love a good love story, and Rachel and Ross’ is hard to beat. While they don’t end up together until the end of the series — when Rachel famously gets off the plane — their love story is honest, relatable, and a modern-day fairytale.</div>

		<h3>Ross</h3><div>
		<p><div>1. He is a doctor being a doctor doesn’t make you the best, but it’s one reason why fans love Ross Geller. That said, they mostly love the way his friends make fun of him for not being a so-called “real doctor.” On the show, Ross is a paleontologist and holds a Ph.D. However, if you ask Joey, he would just say Ross “studies dinosaurs.”</div><div>2. His flirting is on point one reason why Ross is the best Friends character? His flirting skills — or lack thereof. Remember when he used stories about gas to flirt? With that kind of flirting, his friends (and fans) have no idea how he has been married so many times.,</div><div>3. He understands Unagi remember when Ross got super intense about Unagi? Only, he got the word completely wrong. What Ross was actually referring to was “zanshin,” a Japanese martial arts term that describes relaxed awareness.</div><div>4. He has loved Rachel since high school it’s no secret that much of the show’s plotline involves the intricate relationship between him and Rachel. And while he might have moved on and gotten married (more than once), he has loved Rachel since they were teenagers.</div><div>5. He dressed up as the holiday armadillo we love Ross’ enthusiasm — especially when it comes to teaching his son, Ben about important things like Hannukah. To get his attention, Ross decided to dress up as a character and teach Ben about the Festival of Lights. Except there was just one problem: There weren’t any relevant costumes. So, he dressed up as an armadillo and called himself the holiday armadillo.</div><div>6. He has a thing for marriage one of the funniest things about Ross is his perceived obsession with marriage. While he might not do it on purpose, his friends get a kick out of how many times he’s been married (and divorced) and always give him a hard time about it.</div><div>7. His spray tan only Ross would have a hard time (and bad luck) figuring out a Mystic Tan machine. After taking too long to count, he ends up spraying his front twice. Oh, Ross.</div><div>8. The way he says ‘pivot’ one of Ross’ most famous lines is “pivot, pivot, pivot!” And we can’t help but laugh every time we think of it. When the delivery fee for his new sofa is too high, he and Rachel agree to deliver it to his place on their own. As they navigated through the stairwell, Ross’ instructions became more annoying (and hilarious) than helpful.</div><div>9. He is Rachel’s lobster another reason why Ross is the best Friends character? He is Rachel’s lobster. We love a good love story, and so do fans. On the series, Ross and Rachel experience a lot of ups and downs in their relationship. However, in the end, they come back to each other and “mate for life” — just like lobsters.</div>

		<h3>Chandler</h3><div>
		<p><div>1. His sense of humor is unmatched chandler loves to poke fun at his friends. And while he can sometimes take it too far, he also helps keep them humble. In many ways, his humor is what brings him closer to his friends — especially Joey who, ironically, shares the same sense of humor.</div><div>2. He’s incredibly blunt if there is an elephant in the room, you can always count on Chandler to be the first to call it out. While his honesty isn’t always appreciated, Chandler helps bring a lot of situations to light and keeps the circle as open as possible (whether they like it or not). At the end of the day, he says what we are all thinking, and we love him for it.</div><div>3. He accepts everyone’s flaws (including his own)there is no one more accepting than Chandler on the show. Chandler chooses to look beyond the nitty-gritty of each character and love his friends despite their flaws. On top of that, he is very open and honest about his own issues. But, rather than hide them or dwell over them, he makes sure everyone knows.</div><div>4. He’s not afraid of Monica while he might act like it at times, Chandler is not afraid of Monica’s intensity. He constantly calls her out for being overly clean and bossy and was once brave enough to unlock her messy storage closet to reveal her darkest secrets.</div><div>5. He is Joey’s bank account talk about a good friend! When Joey struggles financially — which is pretty much the entire series — Chandler doesn’t hesitate to support his friend. And, to top it off, he asks for nothing in return.</div><div>6. He tells jokes in uncomfortable situations everyone can use an ice-breaker from time to time. And, Chandler is definitely that. Whenever he’s uncomfortable, Chandler resorts to a bad joke. And, while it usually makes things even more awkward for him, it makes his friends a little less uncomfortable.</div><div>7. His love for Monica, Chandler and Monica couldn’t be more perfect for each other. From the way he looks at her to the unique bond they share together, they are the best friends couple — which automatically makes Chandler the best character on Friends.</div>

		<h3>Phoebe</h3><div>
		<p><div>1. She’s passionate about animal rights one of the most relatable things about Phoebe is her passion for animals. Not only is she a vegetarian, but she’s also against fur (unless its a family heirloom, of course). Her love of animals was sacrificed during her pregnancy, as she couldn’t kick her meat cravings. In light of her new diet, Joey agreed to stop eating meat to compensate.</div><div>2. Her musical talents we are forever indebted to Phoebe for “Smelly Cat.” And who could forget her infamous holiday song? She should have won a Grammy for rhyming Ross with Santa Claus. And while her music wasn’t exactly a popular genre, it was unique and true to Phoebe.</div><div>3. She’s blunt in addition to her musical talents, Phoebe also has the gift of honesty. While it’s not always given at the right time, Phoebe’s friends can always count on her to be straight up with them.</div><div>4. She’s been through a lot in the series, Phoebe talks a lot about her past. Her mother committed suicide, she lived in a box on the street, has an evil twin, and never met her father — to name a few. Despite all of that, she has a happy outlook on life and is often a voice of positivity to her friends.</div><div>5. Her confidence is unmatched we can all learn something about confidence from Phoebe. Without even realizing it, she’s one of the most confident characters on the show. She knows who she is and owns it always — even when it’s not the most appropriate.</div><div>6. She hates Pottery Barn, Phoebe is far from the mainstream, which is why she spent an entire episode focused on her hatred of Pottery Barn. But, as it turns out, it’s not Pottery Barn she hates — she actually loved the furniture before Rachel told her where it’s from — it’s the idea of Pottery Barn she can’t stand.</div><div>7. She’s a little ‘out there’ one of the biggest reasons why Phoebe is the best Friends character is her “out there” personality. She’s hilarious without even trying and always have something strange to say. And while her eclectic behavior is not typically taken seriously, we could all learn something from her.</div><div>8. Her eccentric style, Phoebe’s style represents a specific type of person living in New York City’s Greenwich Village. It’s bohemian mixed with vintage and a whole lot of eccentricity. And while it is the complete opposite of her fashionista friend, Rachel, Phoebe style is just as trend-setting — even if she doesn’t mean it to be.</div><div>9. She changed her name to Princess Consuela Banana Hammock remember when Phoebe learned you could change your legal name to anything? In typical Phoebe fashion, she came back to the coffee after to reveal her new name, Princess Consuela Banana Hammock. She always takes advantage of golden opportunities.</div><div>10. She’s a good sister
		it’s no secret that Phoebe’s twin sister, Ursula is the polar opposite of her. Despite her awfulness, Phoebe tries to be a good sister and keep her in the loop. That said, she recognizes her sister isn’t the greatest and keeps her distance when she can.</div>
